The MAE 2250 Water Pump project involved designing, machining, and assembling a unique water pump from scratch, while staying within a set budget and manufacturing time restrictions. 

My group produced a triple-spring-loaded peristaltic pump using a CNC-ed central component with hinged arms providing sufficient pressure against the tubing. The use of springs meant the manufacturing tolerances could be very large compared to traditional pumps.

This pump moved 5.5 liters of water, greatly exceeding the desired >1 liter minimum requirement, while staying under-budget by 10%
