## Selected Algorithm Figures

### Potential Functions

> Rectangular objects in the physical world were represented by spherical potential functions in the digital world, with the robot following the inverse gradient towards the goal at a global minimium

### Rapidly-Exploring Random Trees (RRT)

> DESCRIPTION

### Dijkstra's Algorithm (and Delaunay Triangulations)

<a href="/assets/img/amr/dijkstra.png"><img src="/assets/img/amr/dijkstra.png"></a>
> Here, a roadmap is generated via the center points of a Delaunay triangulation of the workspace. A desired start and end point is connected to the center points of the decomposed cells in the workspace, and Dijkstra's algorithm is applied to find the shortest path through the roadmap

### Grid Localization

## Final Competition

### Particle Filter and Noise Data

<a href="/assets/img/amr/comp_noise.png"><img src="/assets/img/amr/comp_noise.png"></a>
> A major strength of our code for the final competition was how well the particle filter handled noise in the depth measurement data. Even with large standard deviations in the error, the robot was still able to traverse the map due to our averaging and filtering method. 

### Roadmap

<a href="/assets/img/amr/comp_roadmap.png"><img src="/assets/img/amr/comp_roadmap.png"></a>
> We built a robust roadmap using a combination of grid-based and random sampling and k-nearest-neighbor connection methods. This created a roadmap that was guaranteed to cover the workspace even with an unknown map, with a low computation time
