description description *UNDER CONSTRUCTION*
* reminder to self to include final comp pdf and flowchart

A large portion of my Spring 2021 semester was spent working on various AMR tasks and projects, and despite the enormous workload, this was a fantastic class that really drew my interest into autonomy and the algorithms behind robotics. 

The class primarily involved sensing, localization, mapping, path planning, motion planning, obstacle and collision avoidance, and multi-robot control. Each algorithm was explained during lecture, and then we were tasked to implement these effectively from scratch in MATLAB. During lab, we used the iRobot Create platform to run our code on physical robots, which required us to deal with imperfect sensors and delays. 

At the end of the year, we divided into teams for a final competition. For this, the robot was placed at an unknown position on an unknown map, and we had to localize and plan our route around the map to maximize the points collected by visting as many waypoints as possible within 5 minutes. 

Key algorithms used:
- Kalman Filter
- Extended Kalman Filter
- Particle Filter
- Grid Localization
- Potential Functions
- Navigation Functions
- Dijkstra's Algorithm
- Delaunay Triangulation / Cell Decomposition
- Feedback Linearization
- Reference frame conversion
- Dead reckoning
- Occupancy grid / Mapping
- Roadmaps
- Rapidly-Exploring Random Trees (RRT)

### Dijkstra's Algorithm (and Delaunay Triangulations)

<a href="/assets/img/amr/dijkstra.png"><img src="/assets/img/amr/dijkstra.png"></a>
> Here, a roadmap is generated via the center points of a Delaunay triangulation of the workspace. A desired start and end point is connected to the center points of the decomposed cells in the workspace, and Dijkstra's algorithm is applied to find the shortest path through the roadmap

### Grid Localization

## Final Competition

### Flowchart

> A general summary of my team's strategy for the final competition

### Particle Filter and Noise Data

<a href="/assets/img/amr/comp_noise.png"><img src="/assets/img/amr/comp_noise.png"></a>
> A major strength of our code for the final competition was how well the particle filter handled noise in the depth measurement data. Even with large standard deviations in the error, the robot was still able to traverse the map due to our averaging and filtering method. 

### Roadmap

<a href="/assets/img/amr/comp_roadmap.png"><img src="/assets/img/amr/comp_roadmap.png"></a>
> We built a robust roadmap using a combination of grid-based and random sampling and k-nearest-neighbor connection methods. This created a roadmap that was guaranteed to cover the workspace even with an unknown map, with a low computation time
