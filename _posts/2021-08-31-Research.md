## Overview

In my three years of working in the Organic Robotics Lab, I spent the last two on an independent research project, where I led the design and development of a soft-robotic morphing wing. This project primarily sought to understand how morphing wings for small-scale drones of the future might be able to handle large-deformation high-speed changes in the flight profile, to improve maneuverability towards what can be seen in birds and their flight. 

In doing so, I focused on three degrees-of-freedom in the morphing – twist, camber, and expansion. This multimodal capability (uncommon amongst other morphing wing research) introduces additional challenges, primarily in the spatial variation of mechanical properties across the wing, depending on where the morphing occurs. There are conflicting goals at play here: the wing must be flexible to enable the morphing, yet stiff to support its own weight and the aerodynamic loads, and additionally, surface buckling must be prevented under all loading conditions. Manufacturing was also a challenge throughout the project, requiring constant testing and iteration on the design, tooling, and processes. 

The final design solved these problems through 3D-printed compliant lattice structures, designed to conform to the surface profile with spatially-variable warping of the unit cell bounding boxes and functional grading of the beam thicknesses. The stiffness of a lattice depends primarily on two factors: the relative sizing of the bounding box in each of its three principal directions (which dictates the angles of intersection between beams), and the beam thickness. With this warped and functionally-graded design, at the root, the wing is resistant to spanwise bending, and compliant in camber. Towards the tip of the wing, the wing becomes stiffer in camber, yet much more compliant in spanwise extension and twist. Therefore, we can localize the camber morphing towards the root, while adjusting the twist at the wing tip (the optimal locations for these morphing modes). 

Additional design elements of the setup include the pre-tensioned silicone skin encompassing the lattice, as well as actuators routed throughout the wing to control the three DOFs. 

The final key element of the wing is its embedded fiber-optic sensing system, using stretchable light guides routed through pathways within the lattice. By connected these to a series of IR emitters and phototransistors, any deformation due to bending or extension will be recorded as a drop in the transmission amplitude. <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/scirobotics.aau2489">Previous research in the ORL</a> has identified this as a means to enable proprioception within soft robotics; currently, we’re looking at enabling state estimation and control within the wing using this sensor network and machine learning. 

This is a brief overview, and more information will be included in the paper, which I will link here when it is published. Check out some of the images below for a better idea of the project!
