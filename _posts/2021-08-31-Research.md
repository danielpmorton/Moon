## Overview

My current research in the Organic Robotics Lab deals with the crossovers between the aerospace field, advanced manufacturing, and soft robotics. I’m currently studying the use of 3D-printed compliant lattice structures to enable multi-degree-of-freedom morphing of a conceptual drone wing – particularly, adjusting twist, camber, and wingspan using actuators housed within the fuselage and routed through the lattice members. The use of these structures can enable large deformations and rapid changes to the aerodynamics and flight control while maintaining a continuous surface curvature (no need for flaps/slats/ailerons). Additionally, a major focus within the ORL’s research recently has been using flexible fiber optics for distributed proprioceptive sensing within soft robotic structures. Currently, the six embedded sensors receive reliable signals under all deformation modes, and because of this, we can use this as a means of state estimation via neural networks in the future. This research is still continuing at Cornell. 

As the leader on this project, I’ve been collaborating with multiple graduate students in the lab, and it’s been great to understand how to best utilize their breadth of skills and experience. Helping them with their own projects too has allowed me to get a better idea of how to improve my own. 

This project has been a fascinating design problem, which has not been without its challenges – for example, developing a skin that can morph alongside the structure and maintain a smooth surface, optimizing a continuous lattice structure such that it has variable mechanical properties depending on the location in the wing, and enabling the manufacturability of all wing segments. After two years of iteration, the final design solves all of these problems by bringing in novel design and manufacturing techniques. 

We also performed wind tunnel testing on seven representative models of the wing under various degrees of morphing, to show how lift and drag are affected (and can be optimized) with morphing

I'm currently placing the finishing touches on the paper - stay tuned for more details!
