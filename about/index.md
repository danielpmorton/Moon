Hello!

I'm currently a graduate student at Stanford, where I'm studying mechanical engineering with a focus on robotics. This past year, I've been working with Jeannette Bohg in the <a href="http://iprl.stanford.edu/">Interactive Perception and Robot Learning Lab</a>, developing a simulation environment and control strategies for maipulating deformable cargo bags in the ISS. 

Before Stanford, I did my undergrad at Cornell, and spent a large fraction of my time there working in the <a href="https://orl.mae.cornell.edu/">Organic Robotics Lab</a> under Rob Shepherd, focusing on the design and optimization of soft robotic morphing wings with embedded proprioceptive sensing. 

In addition, I've had some wonderful internship experiences at Boeing, NASA, and an exciting new robotics startup, Medra. For more information on my work experience, check out my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/danielpmorton/">Linkedin</a>

When I'm not in the lab or in the office, you can usually find me at the Stanford tennis courts ðŸŽ¾, golf course â›³, or on the slopes â›·.

Feel free to scroll through my page and view some of the <a href="/projects">projects</a> I've worked on. Software projects can be found at my <a href="https://github.com/danielpmorton">Github</a>, though much of my work lately has been in private repositories. However, my research will be open-source when it is complete!
